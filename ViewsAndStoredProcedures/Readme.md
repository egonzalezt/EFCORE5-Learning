# Views and Stored Procedures

EF CORE has the ability to execute raw SQL na stored procedures and map to database views making easy to query read-only data.

EF CORE Allows you to work directly with 

* Stored Procedures
* Views
* Scalar functions
* Table view Functions
* Map to queries in DbContext
  using this strategy you can use your own queries instead of EF CORE build that query

# Using views and other Database Object with migrations
