## What is EF Core?

Microsoft's official cross-platform data access framework for .NET

EF CORE is an ORM that is designed to reduce the friction between how data is structured in a relational database thanks to ORM we do not need to build our queries, and methods to transform these queries into objects these job is performed by ORM

ORM infers that classes or objects have a similar structure EF CORE has a mapping layer that gives us a lot more flexibility in how to get from objects to tables and object properties to table columns.

EF CORE can be connected with a lot of different database providers like Mariadb, Mysql, MS SQL, PostgresSQL, etc.
